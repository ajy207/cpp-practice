### Welcome!

This repo houses the practice programs I have written in C++ to begin
my journey into the vast universe of what this language can accomplish.

1. [findMaxNumber.cpp](https://github.com/ajy207/cpp-practice/blob/main/pointer-manipulation-demo/findMaxNumber.cpp)
     - This program uses a function to compute the maximum value in an array of integers, 
       then returns the maximum value to main(). Nothing special.

2. [reverseCharacaters.cpp](https://github.com/ajy207/cpp-practice/blob/main/pointer-manipulation-demo/reverseCharacters.cpp)
     - This program uses a function to reverse the order of a passed cstring. Throws an error
       if the string cannot be reversed (i.e., empty cstring). Practicing error handling and more pointer stuff.

3. [main.cpp](https://github.com/ajy207/cpp-practice/blob/main/driver-class-demo/main.cpp)
     - Demonstrates the usage of the Driver class, showcasing object creation, getter and setter methods. 
       Uses the [Driver.h](https://github.com/ajy207/cpp-practice/blob/main/driver-class-demo/Driver.h) header.

   3a. [Driver.h](https://github.com/ajy207/cpp-practice/blob/main/driver-class-demo/Driver.h)
   - Header file for the Driver class. Contains class declaration, member variables, and function prototypes.

   3b. [Driver.cpp](https://github.com/ajy207/cpp-practice/blob/main/driver-class-demo/Driver.cpp)
   - Implementation file for the Driver class. Contains the definitions of constructor, getter, and setter methods
     declared in [Driver.h](https://github.com/ajy207/cpp-practice/blob/main/driver-class-demo/Driver.h).
