### Welcome!

This repo houses the practice programs I have written in C++ to begin
my journey into the vast universe of what this language can accomplish.

1. [findMaxNumber.cpp](https://github.com/ajy207/cpp-practice/blob/main/findMaxNumber.cpp)
     - This program uses a function to compute the maximum value in an array of integers, 
       then returns the maximum value to main(). Nothing special.

2. [reverseCharacaters.cpp](https://github.com/ajy207/cpp-practice/blob/main/reverseCharacters.cpp)
     - This program uses a function to reverse the order of a passed cstring. Throws an error
       if the string cannot be reversed (i.e., empty cstring). Practicing error handling and more pointer stuff.
